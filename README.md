The main application to run is app2.py. It contains blueprint of courses, users. Users.py file contains different methods where one can get, post, put, delete info of users. Similarly the courses.py, just that it contians courses details. These files when request send mqtt message to the broker and return imediately to the customer. The details on how mqtt messages are sent is in publish_file.py. Then the mqtt broker sends the same message to the subscriber and the subscriber interacts with the database. The details about the subscriber is in subscribe.py file. Subscriber interacts with the database which is database2.py file. This file stores all the information it gets from subscriber in database.db which contains two tables - users, courses using sqlalchemy. I have also included migrations in the app, whenever we need to take screenshots of database before updating the database, we can do that.
